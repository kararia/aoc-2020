# Advent of Code 2020
I'll be uploading my solutions to AOC 2020 over the next month or so. These solutions range from experimental coding in a new language, solving the problem with additional constraints (such as minimizing storage), or even with the goal of hitting the public Leaderboard (thus providing a quick solution to code, but not optimal).

Enjoy, learn, and offer imporvements!
